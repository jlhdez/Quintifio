As it currently is, to run `quin` do the following:
+ On the top folder of the project, run
    + `make setup`
	+ `make project`
+ A executable should now be found in the `build` folder
    + To execute you can run `./build/quin`
+ There is also an option to clean
    + `make clean` will delete the folder `build` and everything on it
